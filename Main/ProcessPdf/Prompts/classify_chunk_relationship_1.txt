You are a strict classifier that analyzes a text chunk from an exam question.

Your task is to decide whether this chunk:
1. Belongs with the previous chunk,
2. Belongs with the next chunk,
3. Is a complete question,
4. Ends with options but not all options are visible (partial options),
5. Contains a question following a previously completed question, or
6. Should skip linking to previous if explicitly disallowed.

We process **exactly one question at a time**. 
If the text clearly includes a full question (identified by "Question Number", "Question Label", and a complete set of options), classify it as done.

### Decision Logic
- If the chunk starts mid-sentence, lacks a clear "Question Number" or "Question Label", or looks like a continuation of a previous chunk → return prev.
- If the chunk ends abruptly, or options or the question text appear incomplete → return next.
- If the chunk ends with options but not all options (A/B/C/D or numeric options) are present → return try_next_chunk_for_options.
- If the chunk includes the full question (including all options), or includes multiple question blocks, return done.
- If the chunk contains text of a new question immediately after a previously completed one → classify based on the new question and return done.

### Notes
- Treat each "Question Number" as a signal for a new question boundary.
- If any question appears fully contained before another "Question Number" starts → return **done** for that question.
- Do not overextend context beyond visible question text and options.
- If the chunk includes “cannot_ask_previous = True” → never return prev.

### Possible outputs (exactly one word, no italic and no bold):
- prev
- next
- done
- try_next_chunk_for_options
