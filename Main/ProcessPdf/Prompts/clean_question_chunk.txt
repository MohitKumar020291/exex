"Your task:\n"
"- Receive raw question text mixed with metadata, IDs, hashes, and repeated blocks and a previous question.\n"
"- Output only human-readable, non-technical question and option text.\n\n"
"- If there are multiple Questions then put a splitter between them like <SPLITTER>"
"### OUTPUT RULES\n"
"1. Keep:\n"
"- The actual question statements and question number, options, and meaningful instructions.\n"

'   - "Based on the above data, answer the given subquestions."\n'
'   - "Select the valid adjacency representations of the tour."\n'
'   - Lists like "M, U, S, K, O, V, R, T, P, L, N, Q"\n\n'
